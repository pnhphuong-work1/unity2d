It is weird to see someone wandering around here!
I think you should get out of here ASAP ...

===HowToGetOut===
If you want to get out, you need to head NORTH.
But there's a big tree that blocked a path, but I lost my axe.
If you want to get out of here, just head EAST from here, into the ravine. There's an orc that may has my axe.
